# Collaborate
There are some To-do's if you like the game and want to contribute to the project, please feel free to take any of this tasks and commit something, Thanks!
- Need to add a counter of bullets and some 'bullet item' mesh to be able to collect bullets that randomly appear.
- Need to fix-upgrade the generation of rocks, it's buggy and need to have some gradual difficulty.
- Need to have some incremental difficulty to be able to have the feeling of a survival game. (Using levels?).
- Need an score counter.
- Need an initial menu with some instructions and a 'Start' button to start the game.
- Need to receive life damage when a collition happens.
- Need a game over message/screen when the life end's.
